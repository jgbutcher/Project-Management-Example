# Full‑Stack Project Management Tool

This repository contains a minimal full‑stack project management tool designed to showcase basic frontend and backend capabilities without relying on any external packages. The intention is to provide a clear, easy‑to‑understand example of how to build an end‑to‑end system using nothing more than the tools included with Node.js and standard web technologies.

## Features

* **Simple REST API** – implemented with Node’s built‑in `http` and `url` modules. It exposes two endpoints:
  * `GET /api/tasks` – returns a JSON array of tasks.
  * `POST /api/tasks` – accepts a JSON payload `{title: string, completed: boolean}` and appends a new task to the list. Each task is assigned a unique identifier on creation.
* **Cross‑Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is enabled so the API can be consumed from a separate frontend running on a different port or from a local `file://` URL.
* **Frontend UI** – a lightweight HTML/JavaScript/CSS interface that fetches tasks from the backend, displays them in a list and allows users to add new tasks via an input field.

## Getting Started

### Backend

The backend resides in the [`backend`](./backend) folder. To run it you only need Node.js (no additional dependencies). Navigate into the folder and start the server:

```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

The server will listen on port `3000` by default. Once running, you can test it by visiting `http://localhost:3000/api/tasks` in your browser or using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks
```

### Frontend

The frontend is located in the [`frontend`](./frontend) folder. No build step is required – simply open the `index.html` file in your browser:

```bash
cd frontend
# double‑click index.html or open it with your preferred browser
```

Ensure the backend is running before loading the page so that the task list can be fetched.

## Project Structure

## Next Steps

This project is intentionally minimal. To further demonstrate full‑stack proficiency you might consider adding the following features:

* Persist tasks using a proper database (e.g. SQLite, PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
* Implement update and delete endpoints and corresponding UI controls.
* Add user authentication and authorization.
* Introduce a frontend framework such as React or Vue and a build tool (Vite, Webpack, etc.) to scale the UI.

Feel free to extend this starter project in whatever direction best showcases your skills.
